      "I was lucky enough to discover Biscoff Spread  (with smudged labels) at the 99 cents store and decided to give it a try since I am such a fan of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40\">Biscoff brand of Belgian speculoos cookies</a> that they have served for many years on Delta Air Lines.  It's an odd concept, a spread made of cookies, but I'm glad that I didn't let that stop me from trying it.<br /><br />The label says that this is a \"European alternative to peanut butter.\"  I completely disagree as it it only has the look and texture of peanut butter.  It smells and tastes just like the Biscoff cookies, but sweeter, with a hint of caramelized sugar and cinnamon.  It is much more like dulce de leche than peanut butter.<br /><br />This spread is good with ice cream; on pancakes, scones, and apples; or just eaten from a spoon as a nice treat after a meal.  A thin layer even salvaged the plain graham crackers I bought by mistake instead of the cinnamon honey variety.  It would also be good on cupcakes, waffles, or popovers.  Eating it on toast doesn't appeal to me but maybe with raisin bread it would be good.  It really is tasty and hard to resist, especially with milk or coffee.<br /><br />The basic recipe for Biscoff spread is speculoos cookies, canola oil, and sugar so it's not particularly healthy.  Each tablespoon has 88 calories with 52 of them from fat.  On the bright side, a tablespoon only has 33 mg of sodium.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Biscoff 57% (wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oils [one or more of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, palm oil], soy flour, brown sugar, sodium bicarbonate, salt, cinnamon), canola oil, sugar, soy lecithin, citric acid.\n",

      "Made bread in both oven and bread machine.  The oven method seems to produce an 'exploded' top, which I assume is from the yeast rising too quickly?  Either way the bread turns out moist and stays fairly well in the fridge.  I always toast the bread on a dark setting which produces a light tan, probably due to the moisture in the loaf.  Every GF bread I have tried has always seem to be much better tasting toasted and I think that is the rule if the GF world?<br /><br />I also use this for pie crust (you do not use the yeast).  The pie crust has 3 variants:<br /><br />1) Standard - 2 sticks of butter<br />2) Flakier - 1 stick of butter and 8 OZ of shortening<br />3) Non Dairy - 1 stick of margarine and 8 OZ of shortening<br /><br />I've tried both the standard and flakier versions and both turned out well.  Never had a complaint about my pies (yet!).  You may want to warm up the bottom crust first or it may be a little raw, but I have also had that happen on regular pie crusts.<br /><br />If you do try the pie crust - make sure you put the mixture in the fridge for a bit to ensure it is cold, otherwise it may be too sticky.  I roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper that has a quick spray of PAM applied.  Makes the transfer to the pie plate a snap!\n",

      "Lipton Decaffeinated Tea is the perfect thing to drink when you want a soothing hot--or cold--beverage. It works wonders to combat laryngitis as well. This tea contains 100% natural orange pekoe and orange pekoe black teas. Moreover, the tea bags contain decaffeinated tea which means you'll never lose a night's sleep to this tea! SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online. Amazon states that this tea has antioxidants and in fact it does--but the antioxidants are in the form of flavonoids which are all natural antioxidants. Scientists still need to conduct more research on this topic; but there is growing evidence at the time of this writing that flavonoids reduce the risk for coronary heart disease as well as the risk of gastric, esophageal and skin cancers. Tea flavonoids can also improve your body's immune system.<br /><br />Yes, you can serve this tea iced with lemon; but I normally find it most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I boil water; I add the tea bag and then I let it steep for a few minutes. I add milk and one packet of \"sweet and low\" and it's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />The price is right, too: the cost per tea bag works out to be about 17 cents per tea bag. You can use a tea bag twice if you wish but after two uses the tea bag has probably served its' \"tour of duty.\"<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking--hot summer's day. Pick some up and try it--you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SMILE\n",

      "25 Years Old Traditional Balsamic Vinegar By Manicardi<br />This is the real balsamic vinegar. It is to be treasured and savored. We love this vinegar served over fresh strawberries. A tablespoon over ice makes a wonderful tonic. The vinegar comes with a small cookbook which contains the recipe for Lucianno Pavarotti's \"Piccatina\", a truly delightful veal dish. This is not salad dressing vinegar. This is a jewel of wonderfully subtle sweet flavors.\n",

      "I got a sample of this stuff at a bbq festival in NYC.<br /><br />It's got an eerie taste to it.  At first I couldn't figure out what the stuff tastes like.<br />It tastes salty and kind of sweet, there is some good almost smoky flavor to it.  Then I figured it out!  It tastes like those bbq potato chips.<br /><br />Let's break down the ingredient list:<br />#1 is salt.  Not a bad thing but don't overdose on it.<br />#2 dehydrated onion - great flavor<br />#3. spices - not sure what this is, but it's probably some proprietary blend with pepper,<br />#4. sugar - this is where the sweetness comes from<br />#5. dehydrated garlic- where more flavor comes from<br />#6. brown sugar - more sweetness, but a different flavor<br />#7. dehydrated tomato - did you know that tomato contains a bunch of natural glutamic acids (like MSG), and you wonder why pizza is so addicting.<br /><br />there's more but more sugar and other stuff in there, but you get the gist of my review.<br /><br />I would be careful about using it.  It can help make formerly nasty tasting cuts of meat and low qualty burger patties really irrestible.<br />It'll make you eat more.<br /><br />Combined with the fat in the patties, it can be an addicting item.  It'll hit all of the taste senses (Unami, salty, sweet, sour, bitter) and make you come back for more.<br /><br />I would rather have a higher quality burger and just season it with salt and pepper, but if you have to get the cheaper quality patties, I think people would like this seasoning.  You can skip the ketchup if you use this seasoning.\n",

      "This was my first time cooking with a Prima Taste kit and was impressed by the full flavor when making curry.  I opted to use shrimp since I didn't have beef on hand and it still came out very delicious.  The flavors are complex and remind me of Thai and Malay foods I've eaten at restaurants.  For those who don't like spicy foods, this does pack quite a punch but not too over the top.  Only slight negatives - there are a bunch of little leaves (keffir lime leaves, I believe) which need to be picked out before serving or while eating as they are not really chewable.  Also, when mixing in the coconut powder blend which comes in a paper pouch, it can be messy.  It left a bit of powder around the stovetop so take extra care to open slowly and/or over the pot/pan where you are mixing the curry to avoid the extra cleanup.  Bon appetit!\n",

      "I usually buy PG Tips or Typhoon english breakfast tea in bags.  I wanted to try loose-leaf tea for a stronger flavor.  Unfortunately, I fill the tea infuser and it is just not as strong as the previously mentioned brands.  As for the packaging, it arrived just as pictured here but you should know the paper bag is plastic lined and has a ziploc to seal it. It's good packaging.  I hate to give it this review and I've only made 4 pots of tea so if my opinion changes later, I'll surely note it here.<br /><br />UPDATE: I figured out I was making a rookie mistake: in my desire to brew a strong tea, I was overfilling the infuser thereby preventing the flow of water.  This tea is not weak after all.  I upgraded from 3 to 4 stars.  Why not 5? I still think the PG Tips has a better flavor.  I am going to keep my subscription to this tea because it's organic.\n",

They satisfy the craving for a sweet, hard candy, but add a wonderful kick of hops, as in a hoppy beer (a la Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) giving them a wonderful semi-tart, slight \"grapefruit\" style flavor.  I have put them out on a candy dish for company, and everyone loves them, gushing \"what are these?\" and \"these are great!\"  Everyone wants to know where to get them, so I direct them to the beercandy.com website, where you can easily order them, along with their other wonderfully beer-flavored (real beer, yet no alcohol) chocolates.

      "We adopted our two year old, female german Shepherd, Cheyenne, from a local shelter last year. We knew nothing about her background or what she ate. I started with a dry food which our previous dog did very well on. Immediately, Cheyenne began having soft stools and diarhea. After a few weeks I tried another premium dry food... same results, soft-serve ice cream stools and sometimes watery stools. Months went by and I tried several other dry and wet foods and dietary supplements with little improvement. It drove me crazy! I took her to the vet and they did tests and ruled out worms, etc... and told me that German Shepherds are known to have stomach issues. Finally, I picked up a bag of Blue Buffalo Freedom / Grain Free... and Cheyenne loved it and her stools immediately firmed up! Most of the time her stools are very normal and firm now... sometimes they are a little soft... but nothing compared to before. I am so happy I tried Blue Buffalo Freedom. I hope that it works as well for you!\n",

      "I used to love this product. I have purchased at least 10 cases over the last year or two. I am less impressed with the quality now and even a little concerned. Hopefully the manufacturer will read this review and be motivated to fix the problem. If not, I will continue to buy the Farmer's Market pumpkin from Target as it is made the right way and costs less.<br /><br />I manage a holistic rescue and boarding sanctuary. If you've ever been in pet rescue/boarding or taken a dog swimming at the beach, you know it is essential to have something that will stop diarrhea quickly. All canned/powdered pumpkin will stop diarrhea caused by saltwater ingestion or diet changes. This product works as well as any but now that this manufacturer is using pumpkins which aren't ripe, the product is less nutritious and harder to feed. Instead of a creamy consistency that will coat kibble, it is now thick and doesn't mix in well. Sometimes it's harder than others but I am notcing an overall trend of less-desirable product. Maybe Amazon is getting the reject product from the manufacturer and not explaining this to the consumer. The Nummy Tum Tum 100% Organic Pumpkin Puree should not be trusted to provide the vitamins that are in regular canned pumpkin. Only a product that is deep orange and mushy is made from ripe pumpkins and will provide the nutrients which are assumed to be in \"pumpkin\". Don't be fooled by yellow, firm pumpkin, it's not ripe.<br /><br />Lastly I want to add that two of my cases have contained badly dented cans that were dented prior to being packed in the box. That is just plain rude.\n",

I had my doubts when I ordered it but my love for Biscoff cookies convinced me to at least try it. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />It's smooth like creamy peanut butter and for those that haven't tasted the wonderfulness that is a Biscoff cookie, it's very hard to adequately describe it's flavor. Another reviewer said it was similar to a graham and I think another one thought it was closer to gingersnaps. I guess those the best american cracker/cookie comparisons, so for lack of better descriptions, imagine those two combined. For what it's worth, if you're like me, I don't really like gingersnaps and grahams are just ok but I think Biscoffs are heavenly. Just take the plunge and buy this spread, it's a great treat just out of the jar & an awesome \"mystery flavor\" for baked goods, everyone will ask you what your secret ingredient is!\n",

      "This oatmeal is the only kind that I have found to be gluten-free.  It is tasty and cooks quicker and has better texture than rolled oat varieties of oatmeal.  The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter in 2004 with lab analysis showing that McCann's had significantly less gluten on median than two other brands; unfortunately, the analysis also showed that one of the four samples of McCann's had high gluten, so it's possible that there may occasionally be bad batches, or it's possible that they mixed up their sample of McCann's with the other brands since the other three samples were so different.  The World Health Organization's definition of gluten free is less than 200 parts per million (ppm), and the more conservative definition is less than 20 ppm.  The four samples of McCann's had gluten contents of:  &lt;3 ppm, 12 ppm, 23 ppm, 760 ppm.  The second brand was around 100-200 ppm.  The third brand was around 300-800 ppm.  McCann's is clearly better.  I have personally had no problems with it, but I have had problems with the second and third brands that they tried.\n",

      "I like the concept here that GoPicnic has.  The box is convenient although I would imagine that a flatter type of design of sorts would make it more 'carryable' for hiking or even camping.<br /><br />I live in earthquake country and always look for things to have to store or have available for a possible disaster.  If you live in EQ, hurricane or Tornado country, this may be a handy thing to add to your store of goods for such an event.  Although the shelf life is somewhat short, you would have to cycle older product out more often.<br /><br />Someone mentioned in another review that the salmon smelled rather 'fishy' which initially raised an eyebrow, but the taste of the salmon was rather good although some may find it spicy.  I found the spicyness more of a zing and it faded quickly with the crackers, edamame and ginger zip trail mix.  The chocolate mini bar in the pack it a dark chocolate that has a very rich taste and a great ending to a quick meal.<br /><br />I want to try the other brands of GoPicnic for the possibility of kids at school using them once in a while for lunch.  Maybe the salmon is too strong for them unless they have their tastes developed for it.<br /><br />The edamame nuts were tasty and good addition. The crackers where nice for the meal and did not add flavor or take away flavor from the salmon and the trail mix was good.<br /><br />Overall, a great little addition for a quick hike.  The box says the total calories is about 410, pretty good for a snack that has so much variety.  I would like to see the price come down some how, however, the way it is packaged probably requires the price that you see.<br /><br />Try GoPicnic and have fun with it.\n",

      "My 12 year old 65 pound mutt was getting ready to be put down from advancing arthritis. I saw a bag of these in a discount bin at a pet store and thought what the heck.. I was not ready to believe the results. Instead of dragging her hind legs to get up and limping for the first few steps like she had for months she was like a puppy again.. That was 3 yars ago she is 15 and still romping ... I love these things so much I started tart cherry extract myself..WOW\n",

      "Jolt-wise, this is a nice, gentle introduction to Extra Bold. (Darker roast, therefore less caffeine than most XB's.) The taste is charcoal, with charcoal notes and a charcoal finish.  I have a sweet tooth and tend to prefer the sweeter, smoother coffees.  However, I occasionally have a Double Black Diamond because it wakes me up without making me jittery.\n",

      "This is an awesome product. I work at a weight loss camp as a nutrition and culinary instructor, which means that one of my duties is to serve snack to the campers twice a day. This one is a FAVORITE around here with the kids AND staff! You can prepare it using applesauce or yogurt, like the box says. Both come out really awesome. They do tend to be a bit gooey when you cut them--not a huge problem though! There is enough stability to cut pieces and serve them for sure. Awesome product. I will be purchasing some when I go home from camp!\n",

This brings me to my only negative comment...the ingredients are only listed as natural and artificial flavors without specifying what they are which would be nice to know.\n",

      "Today I am buying my second bottle of this Kirkland Vanilla Extract, and that alone is a review!<br /><br />While this may not be an absolutely premium product, it is as good as the name brands in teensy, weensy little bottles at the supermarket, and it is drastically less expensive.<br /><br />I have not used this vanilla in baking, only in pudding, and the flavor was perfect. Maybe I am just not fussy. I do know that the teensy, weensy little bottles of Vanilla from the supermarket lasted a whole lot longer because of their cost. I found myself saving them for baked goods or other foods that I made for other people, and, at least in pudding for just myself, I did not use any vanilla to save money. Now I never fail to use vanilla when I want to.\n",

      "I bought this awhile back, thinking that 12 pounds of baking mix seemed absurd, but I am so glad I got it. This mix is wonderful. It makes delicious pancakes, for starters. The pancakes are so good that my gluten eating sister doesn't know the difference between these and her \"regular\" pancakes.<br /><br />But even more important, there are so many things that can be made with the mix. On the back of the package are lots of recipes for quick breads, muffins, waffles, crepes, and biscuits. I made the biscuits today and was impressed. I've had other biscuit mixes before that were entirely too sweet and too dry. These were perfectly flavored and delicious. The mix is also perfect for making roux, which is great for gravies and sauces. I tried making a pizza crust with it and it was okay, but not quite right... the bread mix is probably better.<br /><br />Pamela's Products has an awesome website full of recipes for each baking mix. I highly recommend checking it out. This mix can be used in so many ways, so keep that in mind. I'd say between this and Annalise Roberts' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572840994\">Gluten-Free Baking Classics</a> my gluten-free lifestyle has been a much easier adjustment.<br /><br />I set my subscription for this every six months. I've gone through one bag in about a month, so I think I have it about right. This mix has been amazing for breakfast foods. I recommend it to anyone going gluten-free!\n",
